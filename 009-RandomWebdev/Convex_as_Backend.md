### Convex Functionality Overview

Convex provides a seamless integration with Next.js, allowing you to interact with your database using queries, mutations, and actions. Let's explore each of these functionalities in detail.

### 1. Queries

**Purpose**: Queries are used to fetch data from the Convex database. They are read-only operations and do not modify the database.

**Arguments**: A query function that receives a context object with db.

**Usage**:
- Fetching lists of items
- Retrieving single items based on criteria
- Any read-only data operations

**Code Example**:
Define a query in the Convex directory (`convex/queries.js`):
```javascript
import { query } from "convex/server";

export const getTodos = query(async ({ db }) => {
  return await db.query("todos").collect();
});
```

Use the query in your React component:
```javascript
import { useQuery } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

const TodoList = () => {
  const todos = useQuery(api.todos.getTodos);

  return (
    <ul>
      {todos?.map(todo => (
        <li key={todo._id}>{todo.text}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
```

### 2. Mutations

**Purpose**: Mutations are used to perform write operations in the database. They can create, update, or delete data.

**Usage**:
- Inserting new records
- Updating existing records
- Deleting records

**Code Example**:
Define a mutation in the Convex directory (`convex/mutations.js`):
```javascript
import { mutation } from "convex/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

export const createTodo = mutation({
  args: { text: v.string() },
  handler: async ({ db }, { text }) => {
    await db.insert("todos", { text });
  },
});
```

Use the mutation in your React component:
```javascript
import { useMutation } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

const TodoForm = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState("");
  const createTodo = useMutation(api.todos.createTodo);

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    await createTodo({ text });
    setText("");
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input
        value={text}
        onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="New Todo"
      />
      <button type="submit">Add Todo</button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

### 3. Actions

**Purpose**: Actions are used to perform operations that may involve external APIs or non-transactional logic. They can interact with mutations and queries.

**Usage**:
- Calling third-party APIs
- Performing complex computations
- Orchestrating multiple mutations or queries

**Code Example**:
Define an action in the Convex directory (`convex/actions.js`):
```javascript
import { action } from "convex/server";

export const fetchExternalData = action(async ({ scheduler }, { url }) => {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  const data = await response.json();

  // Schedule a mutation to save data
  await scheduler.runMutation("todos.saveExternalData", { data });
});
```

Define the mutation that the action calls (`convex/mutations.js`):
```javascript
export const saveExternalData = mutation({
  args: { data: v.any() },
  handler: async ({ db }, { data }) => {
    await db.insert("todos", { text: data.title });
  },
});
```

Use the action in your React component:
```javascript
import { useAction } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

const FetchButton = () => {
  const fetchExternalData = useAction(api.todos.fetchExternalData);

  const handleFetch = async () => {
    await fetchExternalData({ url: "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1" });
  };

  return <button onClick={handleFetch}>Fetch Data</button>;
};
```

### 4. Schema and Type Safety

**Purpose**: Schemas define the structure of your data, ensuring type safety and consistency in your database operations.

**Usage**:
- Generating and using schema files
- Enforcing data types in queries, mutations, and actions

**Code Example**:
Define a schema (`convex/schema.ts`):
```typescript
export const schema = {
  todos: {
    text: String,
    createdAt: { type: Date, default: () => new Date() },
  },
};
```

Use the schema in your queries and mutations:
```javascript
import { schema } from "../convex/schema";
import { query, mutation } from "convex/server";

export const getTodos = query(async ({ db }) => {
  return await db.query(schema.todos).collect();
});

export const createTodo = mutation({
  args: { text: schema.todos.text },
  handler: async ({ db }, { text }) => {
    await db.insert(schema.todos, { text });
  },
});
```

### 5. Authentication

**Purpose**: Integrate user authentication to protect your application and manage user-specific data.

**Usage**:
- Setting up user authentication using Clerk
- Protecting routes and database operations

**Code Example**:
Integrate Clerk for authentication:
```javascript
import { ClerkProvider, RedirectToSignIn, SignedIn, SignedOut } from "@clerk/nextjs";

const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps }) => (
  <ClerkProvider {...pageProps}>
    <SignedIn>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </SignedIn>
    <SignedOut>
      <RedirectToSignIn />
    </SignedOut>
  </ClerkProvider>
);
```

Protect your API routes:
```javascript
import { requireSession, withSession } from "@clerk/nextjs/api";

const handler = withSession(async (req, res) => {
  const { userId } = req.session;
  // Your code here
});

export default requireSession(handler);
```

### 6. File Storage

**Purpose**: Store and manage files directly within Convex.

**Usage**:
- Uploading files
- Accessing and managing stored files

**Code Example**:
Set up file storage in Convex:
```javascript
import { action } from "convex/server";

export const uploadFile = action(async ({ storage }, { file }) => {
  const fileId = await storage.upload(file);
  return fileId;
});
```

Use the file storage action in your React component:
```javascript
import { useAction } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

const FileUpload = () => {
  const uploadFile = useAction(api.todos.uploadFile);

  const handleFileChange = async (e) => {
    const file = e.target.files[0];
    const fileId = await uploadFile({ file });
    console.log("Uploaded file ID:", fileId);
  };

  return <input type="file" onChange={handleFileChange} />;
};
```

### 7. Scheduling

**Purpose**: Schedule tasks to run at specific times or intervals, similar to cron jobs.

**Usage**:
- Setting up scheduled tasks
- Automating repetitive operations

**Code Example**:
Define a scheduled task in Convex:
```javascript
import { action } from "convex/server";

export const scheduleTask = action(async ({ scheduler }) => {
  await scheduler.runAt(new Date(Date.now() + 60000), "todos.scheduledTask");
});

export const scheduledTask = action(async ({ db }) => {
  // Your scheduled task logic here
  await db.insert("todos", { text: "Scheduled task executed" });
});
```

### Summary

Convex offers a powerful and flexible set of functionalities for building modern web applications. By leveraging queries, mutations, actions, schemas, authentication, file storage, and scheduling, you can create robust, scalable, and secure applications with ease. The seamless integration with Next.js and the real-time capabilities of Convex make it an excellent choice for modern web development.
