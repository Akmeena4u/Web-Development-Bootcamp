**Summary of Asynchronous Actions in Redux:**

1. **Introduction to Asynchronous Actions:**
   - Asynchronous actions involve fetching data from an API endpoint and updating the Redux store based on the API response.
   - A new application is introduced to fetch a list of users and store them in the Redux store.

2. **State Definition:**
   - The state of the application is represented by an object with three properties:
     - `loading`: A flag indicating whether data is currently being fetched.
     - `users`: An array to store the list of users.
     - `error`: A string to store an error message if the API request fails.
   - The initial state is defined with default values.

   ```javascript
   const initialState = {
     loading: false,
     users: [],
     error: "",
   };
   ```

3. **Action Types and Creators:**
   - Three action types are defined for the three stages of the asynchronous process:
     - `fetch_users_request`
     - `fetch_users_success`
     - `fetch_users_failure`
   - Action creators are functions that return corresponding actions.

   ```javascript
   const fetch_users_request = "FETCH_USERS_REQUEST";
   const fetch_users_success = "FETCH_USERS_SUCCESS";
   const fetch_users_failure = "FETCH_USERS_FAILURE";

   const fetchUsersRequest = () => ({ type: fetch_users_request });
   const fetchUsersSuccess = (users) => ({ type: fetch_users_success, payload: users });
   const fetchUsersFailure = (error) => ({ type: fetch_users_failure, payload: error });
   ```

4. **Reducer Function:**
   - The reducer function handles the state transitions based on the action types.
   - It updates the state object according to the action received.

   ```javascript
   const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
     switch (action.type) {
       case fetch_users_request:
         return { ...state, loading: true };
       case fetch_users_success:
         return { ...state, loading: false, users: action.payload, error: "" };
       case fetch_users_failure:
         return { ...state, loading: false, users: [], error: action.payload };
       default:
         return state;
     }
   };
   ```

5. **Setting up Redux Store:**
   - Import necessary Redux functions (`createStore`) and set up the Redux store with the reducer function.

   ```javascript
   const redux = require("redux");
   const createStore = redux.createStore;

   const store = createStore(reducer);
   ```

6. **Next Steps - Making API Calls:**
   - The next steps involve making API calls and dispatching the appropriate actions based on the response.
   - The implementation of API calls and asynchronous actions will be covered in the next chapter.

 # Summary of Using Async Actions with Redux Thunk

1. **Introduction to Async Actions:**
   - The focus is on incorporating asynchronous actions in Redux using Axios for API requests and Redux Thunk middleware.

2. **Package Installation:**
   - Two packages need to be installed: Axios for making API requests and Redux Thunk for handling asynchronous actions.
   - Install the packages using the command: `npm install axios redux-thunk`.

3. **Applying Redux Thunk Middleware:**
   - Import `applyMiddleware` from Redux and Redux Thunk.
   - Apply Redux Thunk middleware to the Redux store using `applyMiddleware`.

   ```javascript
   const applyMiddleware = redux.applyMiddleware;
   const thunkMiddleware = require('redux-thunk').default;

   const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(thunkMiddleware));
   ```

4. **Setting Up Axios:**
   - Import Axios for making API requests.

   ```javascript
   const axios = require('axios');
   ```

5. **Async Action Creator:**
   - Define an asynchronous action creator, such as `fetchUsers`, which returns a function instead of an action.
   - This function receives the `dispatch` method as an argument, allowing it to dispatch regular actions.

   ```javascript
   const fetchUsers = () => {
     return function (dispatch) {
       dispatch(fetchUsersRequest());

       axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
         .then((response) => {
           dispatch(fetchUsersSuccess(response.data.map(user => user.id)));
         })
         .catch((error) => {
           dispatch(fetchUsersFailure(error.message));
         });
     };
   };
   ```

6. **Dispatching Actions:**
   - Within the async action creator, dispatch the appropriate actions based on the API response.
   - For example, dispatch `fetchUsersRequest` to set loading to true, `fetchUsersSuccess` for a successful response, and `fetchUsersFailure` for an error.

   ```javascript
   dispatch(fetchUsersRequest());
   dispatch(fetchUsersSuccess(response.data.map(user => user.id)));
   dispatch(fetchUsersFailure(error.message));
   ```

7. **Testing Async Action:**
   - Subscribe to the Redux store and dispatch the async action creator.

   ```javascript
   store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()));
   store.dispatch(fetchUsers());
   ```

8. **Observing Action Logs:**
   - Observe the action logs in the console, showing the dispatching of actions during the asynchronous process.

9. **Conclusion:**
   - Redux Thunk middleware allows action creators to return functions, enabling asynchronous tasks like API calls.
   - Axios is used for making asynchronous requests, and the appropriate actions are dispatched based on the API response.
   - The concept is crucial for handling asynchronous behavior in Redux applications.

10. **Next Steps - Integrating with React:**
    - The knowledge gained in Redux can now be extended to React applications.
