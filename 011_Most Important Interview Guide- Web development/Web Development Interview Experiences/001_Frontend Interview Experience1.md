>
> **A:** Media queries are used to make a webpage responsive by applying different styles based on the device's characteristics such as width and height.

### Margin vs Padding

> **Q:** What is the difference between margin and padding?
>
> **A:** Margin is the space outside the border of an element, while padding is the space between the content and the border.

### Callback Function

> **Q:** What is a callback function?
>
> **A:** A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument and is executed after some operation has been completed.

### Promises

> **Q:** What is a promise?
>
> **A:** A promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

### Event Loop

> **Q:** What is the event loop in JavaScript?
>
> **A:** The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations by offloading operations to the system kernel whenever possible.

### SASS

> **Q:** What is SASS?
>
> **A:** SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a CSS preprocessor that allows the use of variables, nested rules, and other features to make CSS more maintainable.

### AJAX

> **Q:** What is AJAX?
>
> **A:** AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages by allowing parts of a webpage to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server.

### Git Commands

> **Q:** Can you tell me some git commands you know?
>
> **A:** 
> - `git status`: Shows the status of changes as untracked, modified, or staged.
> - `git add`: Adds files to the staging area.
> - `git commit -m "message"`: Commits the staged changes with a message.
> - `git push`: Pushes commits to a remote repository.
> - `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository to the local branch.

### Null vs Undefined

> **Q:** What is the difference between null and undefined?
>
> **A:** `undefined` is the default value of a variable that has been declared but not initialized. `null` is an assignment value that represents no value or no object.

### ES6 Features

> **Q:** What are some new features in ES6?
>
> **A:** 
> - Arrow functions
> - Template literals
> - `let` and `const` keywords
> - Destructuring assignment
> - Modules
> - Classes

### Arrow Function vs Normal Function

> **Q:** What is the difference between an arrow function and a normal function?
>
> **A:** Arrow functions are shorter and do not have their own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target` bindings. Normal functions have their own `this` context and are suitable for methods in object-oriented programming.

### Closures

> **Q:** What is a closure in JavaScript?
>
> **A:** A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the scope of the outer function, and the global scope. It allows a function to access variables from an enclosing scope even after it leaves the scope in which it was declared.

### This Keyword

> **Q:** What is the `this` keyword in JavaScript?
>
> **A:** The `this` keyword refers to the object it belongs to. In a method, `this` refers to the owner object. Alone, `this` refers to the global object.

### React

> **Q:** What is React?
>
> **A:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where data changes dynamically over time.

### JSX

> **Q:** What is JSX?
>
> **A:** JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML and is used with React to describe what the UI should look like.

### Life Cycle Methods

> **Q:** What are the life cycle methods in React?
>
> **A:** 
> - Mounting: `componentDidMount`
> - Updating: `componentDidUpdate`
> - Unmounting: `componentWillUnmount`
> - Error Handling: `componentDidCatch`

### Hooks

> **Q:** How can life cycle methods be achieved in functional components?
>
> **A:** Life cycle methods in functional components can be achieved using the `useEffect` hook.

### Ref

> **Q:** What is `ref` in React?
>
> **A:** `ref` is used to access the DOM elements directly and interact with them, like setting focus or reading the value of an input.

### Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components

> **Q:** What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?
>
> **A:** Controlled components are those where the form data is handled by a React component. Uncontrolled components are those where the form data is handled by the DOM itself.

### Higher Order Functions

> **Q:** What are higher order functions in JavaScript?
>
> **A:** Higher order functions are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as output.

### Map, Filter, Reduce

> **Q:** What is the difference between `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` in JavaScript?
>
> **A:** 
> - `map` creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the original array.
> - `filter` creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
> - `reduce` applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array to reduce it to a single value.

### State vs Props

> **Q:** What is the difference between state and props in React?
>
> **A:** `props` are read-only and are used to pass data from parent to child components, while `state` is a local data storage that is mutable and managed within the component.

### React Router

> **Q:** What is React Router?
>
> **A:** React Router is a library used to handle routing in React applications, allowing navigation between different components.

### Performance Optimization

> **Q:** How can you optimize the performance of a web application?
>
> **A:** 
> - Minify and compress images and files.
> - Use lazy loading for images and components.
> - Optimize meta tags.
> - Reduce nested components.
> - Utilize caching and content delivery networks (CDNs).

### Flexbox

> **Q:** What is Flexbox in CSS?
>
> **A:** Flexbox is a layout model that allows items in a container to be automatically arranged to adjust their size and position to best fit the available space.

### Virtual DOM vs Real DOM

> **Q:** What is the difference between the virtual DOM and the real DOM?
>
> **A:** The real DOM updates every time there is a change, which can be slow and resource-intensive. The virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM that allows for efficient updates by comparing the differences and only updating the changed parts.
