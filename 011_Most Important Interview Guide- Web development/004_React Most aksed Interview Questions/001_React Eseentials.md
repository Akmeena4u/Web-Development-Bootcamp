### Setting Up React App**

**1. Why is Node.js important for setting up a React project?**  
> Node.js provides the runtime environment for executing JavaScript outside a browser and includes npm, which manages the dependencies required for a React project.*

**2. How do you create and start a new React project?**  
> Use `npx create-react-app myreactproject` for Create React App or `npm create vite@latest` for Vite. Start the project by navigating to the folder and running `npm run start` (Create React App) or `npm run dev` (Vite).

**3. What is the purpose of the `npm run build` command, and what should be done after it?**  
> `npm run build` creates an optimized, production-ready version of the React application. After building, deploy the output files to hosting platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.*

**4. What are the advantages of using Vite over Create React App?**  
> Vite offers faster build times, hot module replacement (HMR), and more flexible configuration, making it ideal for performance-sensitive projects. HMR is a feature in modern JavaScript development tools, like Vite and Webpack, that allows you to update modules in a running application without requiring a full page reload.
