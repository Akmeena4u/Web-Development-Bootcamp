### React Router Interview Questions

React Router is widely used with React applications to route and navigate between the applications. Here are some common questions that we should prepare for interviews, especially for frontend development or full stack development roles.

#### 1. What is React Router?
> React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.

#### 2. How do you install React Router?
> You can install React Router using npm or yarn:
> 
> Using npm:
> ```
> npm install react-router-dom
> ```
> Using Yarn:
> ```
> yarn add react-router-dom
> ```

#### 3. What are the benefits of using React Router?
> - **Declarative Routing**: React Router provides a declarative way to define routing in your application using JSX syntax. This makes it easy to understand and maintain the routing configuration of your application.
> - **Dynamic Routing**: React Router supports dynamic routing, that allows you to define routes with parameters that can change based on user input or application state. This makes it easy to create dynamic and data-driven UIs.
> - **Code Splitting**: React Router supports code splitting that allows you to split your application into smaller chunks that are loaded on demand.
> - **History Management**: React Router provides a history API that allows you to programmatically navigate between different pages in your application, as well as manage browser history (e.g., go back, go forward).
> - **Server-Side Rendering**: React Router is compatible with server-side rendering (SSR) frameworks like Next.js, allowing you to render React components on the server and send the fully rendered HTML to the client. This can improve SEO and initial load performance.

#### 4. Can we use React Router with server-side rendering?
> Yes, React Router can be used with server-side rendering (SSR). While React Router primarily handles client-side routing, it is compatible with server-side rendering frameworks like Next.js that allows you to render React components on the server and send the fully rendered HTML to the client.

#### 5. What is browser history in React Router?
> In React Router, the browser history represents the user’s navigation actions and URL changes within a web browser. React Router provides a history object that allows programmatically manipulating the browser’s history that enable features like navigation, back and forward actions, and accessing location information.
> 
> ```javascript
> import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
> 
> function MyComponent() {
>     const history = useHistory();
> 
>     function handleClick() {
>         // Programmatically navigate to a new route
>         history.push('/new-route');
>     }
> }
> ```

#### 6. Do all routers have to be declared on a single page or can they be spread across multiple pages?
> In React Router, routers can be declared across multiple pages or components within your application. It’s common to have multiple routers spread across different parts of your application, especially in larger projects or when using frameworks like Next.js for server-side rendering. Each router instance manages a specific portion of your application’s UI and navigation logic.
