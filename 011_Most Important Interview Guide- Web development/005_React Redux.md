# Answers

## Answer 1
### What is the purpose of the React `useState` hook?
The `useState` hook is a function that lets you add state to functional components in React.

## Answer 2
### How do you handle user authentication in a Next.js application?
You can handle user authentication in a Next.js application using libraries like Clerk or NextAuth.js.

## Answer 3
### What is the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP)?
The Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) is a mathematical problem that underlies the security of many cryptographic algorithms. It involves finding the exponent in the expression \( b^x \equiv g \mod p \), where \( b \), \( g \), and \( p \) are known, but \( x \) is unknown.

## Answer 4
### What is YOLO version 3 in computer vision?
YOLO (You Only Look Once) version 3 is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. It frames object detection as a single regression problem, straight from image pixels to bounding box coordinates and class probabilities.
