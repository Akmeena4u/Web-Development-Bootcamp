#1-Disadvantages of using Directives->

In Tailwind A number of classes are added to each of the HTML elements. Thus, The tailwind CSS has provided the feature of @apply and @layer directive but
this benefit comes with a price. By using directive, You are actually shifting the maintainability of the application to the global CSS file.

For example, You have created a button and shifted all the utility classes in a custom ‘btn’ class in the global CSS file. In that case, You have to revisit
the global CSS file repeatedly. Thus, It will be hindering your developer experience and would become similar to writing Traditional CSS.



  #2_When to Use Directives?

  Eventually, You must use directives when you are in a situation to reuse the components multiple times in your application. Otherwise, 
  If you are creating a component for single-use then you must avoid using the directives. Moreover, while using apply directive one must make
  sure to choose the custom class name very wisely to avoid any confusion in the future.
