### Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Basic HTTP Server in Node.js
- The Node.js HTTP module is a core module that provides the necessary functionality to create HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) servers and make HTTP requests. With the HTTP module, you can build web servers, APIs, and interact with other web services.


#### 1. Setting Up the Project

First, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can check the installation by running:

```bash
node -v
```

Now, let's create a new directory for our project and initialize a new Node.js project using npm (Node Package Manager).

```bash
mkdir my-server
cd my-server
npm init -y
```

#### 2. Installing Required Packages

For creating an HTTP server in Node.js, we don't need any additional packages beyond the core Node.js modules. Node.js provides the `http` module for this purpose.

#### 3. Creating the Server File (`index.js`)

Create a file named `index.js` in your project directory. This file will contain the code to create and start our HTTP server.

```javascript
// index.js

// Importing the 'http' module
const http = require('http');

// Port number to run the server on
const port = 8000;

// Creating a simple HTTP server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  // Setting the response HTTP header with a success status code and content type
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });

  // Sending the response body "Hello from Server"
  res.end('Hello from Server\n');
});

// Binding the server to listen on the specified port
server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}/`);
});
```

#### 4. Understanding the Code

- **`require('http')`:** This imports the built-in HTTP module in Node.js, which allows us to create an HTTP server.
  
- **`const server = http.createServer(callback)`:** This creates a new HTTP server instance. The `createServer` method takes a callback function as an argument. This callback function is called whenever a request is made to the server.

- **`req` and `res` in the Callback Function:**
  - `req` (request): Represents the HTTP request from the client. It includes information about the request such as headers, method, URL, etc.
  - `res` (response): Represents the HTTP response that will be sent back to the client. We use methods like `res.writeHead()` to set the HTTP status code and headers, and `res.end()` to send the response body.

- **`res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' })`:** Sets the HTTP status code to `200` (which means "OK") and the `Content-Type` header to `text/plain`, indicating that the response body will be plain text.

- **`res.end('Hello from Server\n')`:** Sends the response body with the text "Hello from Server" and ends the response.

- **`server.listen(port, callback)`:** Binds the server to the specified port (`8000` in this case) and starts listening for incoming requests. The optional callback function is executed once the server is successfully started.

#### 5. Running the Server

To run the server, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
node index.js
```

This will start your Node.js server. You should see the message `Server is running at http://localhost:8000/` logged to the console.

#### 6. Testing the Server

Open a web browser or use a tool like `curl` or `Postman` to visit `http://localhost:8000/`. You should see the response `Hello from Server` displayed in your browser or returned by the tool.

#### Summary

This tutorial covers the basic steps to create an HTTP server using Node.js. It demonstrates how to set up a simple server that responds to HTTP requests with a plain text response. This foundational knowledge is essential for building more complex server-side applications in Node.js.
