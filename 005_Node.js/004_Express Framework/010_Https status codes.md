### Understanding HTTP Response Status Codes

HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by a server in response to a client's request. They provide information about the status of the request and are grouped into five classes:

1. **1xx (Informational):** These status codes indicate that the request was received and understood and that the client should continue with its request.
   - Example: 100 Continue, 101 Switching Protocols

2. **2xx (Success):** These indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
   - **200 OK:** Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method.
   - **201 Created:** The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.
   - **204 No Content:** The server successfully processed the request but is not returning any content.

3. **3xx (Redirection):** These status codes indicate that further action needs to be taken by the client to fulfill the request.
   - **301 Moved Permanently:** The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
   - **302 Found:** The requested resource resides temporarily under a different URL.
   - **304 Not Modified:** Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers, and there is no need to retransmit the requested resource.

4. **4xx (Client Error):** These indicate that there was an error on the client side of the request.
   - **400 Bad Request:** The server cannot process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax).
   - **401 Unauthorized:** Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.
   - **404 Not Found:** The server cannot find the requested resource.

5. **5xx (Server Error):** These indicate that the server failed to fulfill a valid request due to an error on its part.
   - **500 Internal Server Error:** A generic error message indicating that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
   - **503 Service Unavailable:** The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance of the server.

### Example Use Case

If you're developing a web application with Node.js and Express, handling these status codes effectively can enhance user experience and provide meaningful feedback. For instance:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Example route handling
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  if (userId === 'admin') {
    res.status(200).send('Welcome, admin user!');
  } else if (userId === 'guest') {
    res.status(403).send('Unauthorized access');
  } else {
    res.status(404).send('User not found');
  }
});

// Starting the server
const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

In this example:
- A GET request to `/users/:id` checks if the `userId` is 'admin', 'guest', or any other value.
- Depending on the value of `userId`, different HTTP status codes (`200`, `403`, `404`) are sent along with corresponding messages.

### Commanly used Http Status codes 

Certainly! Here's a tabular note explaining each HTTP status code individually:

### Conclusion

Understanding HTTP status codes is crucial for building robust and user-friendly web applications. Each status code provides specific information about the success or failure of a request, allowing clients and servers to communicate effectively. By utilizing status codes correctly in your Node.js applications, you can improve error handling, user experience, and overall application reliability.
