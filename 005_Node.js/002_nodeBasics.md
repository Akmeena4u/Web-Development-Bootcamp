## Overview of Node.js and Modules

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser, particularly on server-side applications. reason for this is that Ryan dahl extracted the chorome V8 engine and embeded with cpp to talk with machines and handle files and all, but here dom related things were excluded . It utilizes the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine to execute code efficiently. Node.js supports modular programming through various module systems, primarily CommonJS and ES Modules, allowing developers to organize and reuse code effectively.

### Working of nodejs
- Node.js operates on a single-threaded event loop, using non-blocking I/O and asynchronous event-driven programming to handle concurrency efficiently.
- Firstly all the execution statements come under the Event queue
- All task goes under the Event loop - Event loop has a Call stack, web API queue, a callback queue
- All synchronous tasks executed line by line using call stack 
- asynchronous task went into web API . this is a thread pool and by default no. of thread will be equals to cores and each async task will get one thread to complete thetask and remaing threads 
 waits and if execution is completed they will go under the callback queue  and if call stack is empty at that moment these will enter into call stack

### Key Features of Node.js

- **Server-Side Development**: Node.js is widely used for building server-side applications like web servers, API servers, and real-time applications such as chat and gaming platforms.
  
- **JavaScript**: It enables developers to use JavaScript for both client-side (browser) and server-side programming, which streamlines the development process for JavaScript developers.
  
- **Event-Driven, Non-Blocking I/O**: Node.js operates on an event-driven, non-blocking model, which enhances scalability by efficiently managing concurrent connections without heavy resource utilization.

- **Node Package Manager (NPM)**: Node.js includes NPM, a robust package manager that simplifies the installation and management of third-party libraries and modules.

### Types of Modules in Node.js

#### 1. Built-In (Core) Modules

Node.js provides a set of core modules for essential functionalities like file I/O operations, HTTP/HTTPS server creation, path manipulation, utility functions, OS information retrieval, event handling, and stream data processing. These modules can be accessed using the `require` function.

Example:
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const http = require('http');
const path = require('path');
// and others...
```

#### 2. User-Defined Modules

Developers can create custom modules in Node.js by defining functions or variables within a JavaScript file. These modules can be reused across applications by exporting their functionalities using `module.exports` or `exports`.

Example:

**mymodule.js**
```javascript
exports.myFunction = function() {
  console.log('This is a custom function in mymodule.js');
};
```

Usage:
```javascript
const myModule = require('./mymodule.js');
myModule.myFunction();
```

#### 3. Third-Party Modules

Node.js boasts a vast ecosystem of third-party modules available via NPM. These modules extend the functionality of Node.js by providing ready-made solutions for various tasks like web frameworks (e.g., Express.js), database integration, authentication, testing, and more.

Example:
```bash
npm install express
```

Usage:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
// Use Express.js to build your server
```

### Module System Types

Node.js supports two primary module systems:

#### CommonJS Modules

- **Definition**: CommonJS is the traditional module system used in Node.js, relying on `require()` to import modules and `module.exports` or `exports` to export functionalities.

Example:
```javascript
// lib.js
exports.sum = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

// index.js
const module = require('./lib.js');
console.log(module.sum(2, 3)); // Output: 5
```

#### ES Modules (ECMAScript Modules)

- **Definition**: ES Modules are the standardized module system in JavaScript, introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). They use `import` and `export` statements for module import/export.

Example:
```javascript
// lib.js
export function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// index.js
import { sum } from './lib.js';
console.log(sum(2, 3)); // Output: 5
```

### Conclusion

Node.js modules facilitate code organization, reusability, and collaboration within the JavaScript ecosystem. With built-in, user-defined, and third-party modules, developers can efficiently build scalable, maintainable, and feature-rich applications using Node.js. Understanding module systems like CommonJS and ES Modules is fundamental for effective Node.js development.
