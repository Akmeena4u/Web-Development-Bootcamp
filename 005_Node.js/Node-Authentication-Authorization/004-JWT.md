# JSON Web Tokens (JWT) Notes

## What is JWT?

JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is used for authorization, not authentication. Authentication verifies a user's identity, while authorization checks if the user has access to a specific resource.

## How JWT Works

1. Traditional Session-Based Authentication:
   - User logs in, server stores session in memory.
   - Server sends a session ID (via cookie) to the client.
   - Client sends the session ID with each request.
   - Server checks the session ID to authorize the user.

2. JWT-Based Authorization:
   - User logs in, server creates a JWT.
   - Server sends the JWT to the client.
   - Client sends the JWT with each request.
   - Server verifies the JWT signature to authorize the user.

## JWT Structure

- **Header**: Contains metadata about the token (e.g., algorithm).
- **Payload**: Contains user information (e.g., user ID, name, expiration time).
- **Signature**: Ensures token integrity and authenticity.

## JWT Benefits

- No need to store session state on the server.
- Works well in distributed environments with multiple servers.
- Allows seamless authentication across different services and servers.

## Use Cases for JWT

1. Seamless User Authentication:
   - User logs in once and can access multiple services without reauthentication.
2. Microservices Architecture:
   - JWT allows authentication across various microservices in a distributed system.
3. Load Balancing:
   - Users can switch between servers without losing authentication state.

## Conclusion

JWT simplifies authentication and authorization in modern web applications, offering flexibility and scalability in managing user sessions and access control.

Here are detailed notes on JSON Web Tokens (JWT) along with code examples in a markdown (md) format:

# JSON Web Tokens (JWT) Overview

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a compact and self-contained way of securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. They are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications.

## JWT Structure

A JWT consists of three parts separated by dots: `header.payload.signature`

- **Header**: Contains metadata about the token such as the type (`"typ"`) and the signing algorithm (`"alg"`).
- **Payload**: Contains the claims or statements about an entity (user) and additional data. There are three types of claims: registered, public, and private claims.
- **Signature**: Used to verify the authenticity of the token and to ensure that it has not been tampered with. It is created by encoding the header, payload, and a secret key with the specified algorithm.

## JWT Workflow

1. **Authentication**: When a user logs in, a JWT is created and sent to the client.
2. **Authorization**: The client includes the JWT in subsequent requests to access protected resources on the server.
3. **Validation**: The server verifies the JWT's signature and checks if the user is authorized to access the requested resource.

## Code Examples

Here's a step-by-step guide with code examples for JWT token handling, including token creation, authentication, refresh token generation, and authentication of refreshed tokens.

### Step 1: Install Required Packages
First, install the necessary packages using npm:

```bash
npm install jsonwebtoken express body-parser
```

### Step 2: Create a Basic Express Server
Create a basic Express server with endpoints for token creation, authentication, and refresh token generation.

```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;
const secretKey = 'your_secret_key';

app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Endpoint to generate JWT token
app.post('/api/login', (req, res) => {
  const { username, password } = req.body;
  // In a real application, you would validate the username and password

  // Create JWT token
  const token = jwt.sign({ username }, secretKey, { expiresIn: '1h' });
  res.json({ token });
});

// Middleware to verify JWT token
const verifyToken = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers['authorization'];
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Token not provided' });

  jwt.verify(token, secretKey, (err, decoded) => {
    if (err) return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Invalid token' });
    req.user = decoded.username;
    next();
  });
};

// Protected endpoint using JWT authentication
app.get('/api/data', verifyToken, (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Protected data accessed', user: req.user });
});

// Endpoint to refresh JWT token
app.post('/api/refresh-token', verifyToken, (req, res) => {
  const token = jwt.sign({ username: req.user }, secretKey, { expiresIn: '1h' });
  res.json({ token });
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### Step 3: Test the Endpoints
Now, let's test the endpoints using a tool like Postman or cURL.

1. **Token Generation Endpoint:** Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/api/login` with JSON body containing `username` and `password` to get a JWT token.
2. **Protected Endpoint:** Send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/api/data` with the JWT token in the `Authorization` header to access protected data.
3. **Refresh Token Endpoint:** Send a POST request to `http://localhost:3000/api/refresh-token` with the JWT token in the `Authorization` header to refresh the token.

### Notes:
- Replace `'your_secret_key'` with your actual secret key.
- In a real application, you would have proper user authentication and validation mechanisms.
- The `verifyToken` middleware is used to authenticate JWT tokens before accessing protected endpoints.
