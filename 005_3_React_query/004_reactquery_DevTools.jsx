/*The React Query Devtools is a useful tool that helps us inspect and debug the behavior of our queries and mutations when using React Query in our application. 
It provides a visual interface for monitoring and managing the state of your queries.   */

//Install React Query Devtools:
npm install react-query/devtools --save


//Import and Add React Query Devtools to our App:
//In our main application file, we can import and add the React Query Devtools component. This is typically done in the file where we  set up our React Query client
// In your main application file or configuration file
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from 'react-query';
import { ReactQueryDevtools } from 'react-query/devtools'; // Import the Devtools

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

function App() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      {/* Your app components */}
      <ReactQueryDevtools initialIsOpen={false} position="bottom-right" /> {/* Add the Devtools component */}
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}


/*
initialIsOpen: Set this to true if we want the Devtools to be open by default.
position: Set the desired position for the Devtools, such as "top-right," "top-left," "bottom-right," or "bottom-left."

*/

//Accessing the Devtools:
//When ywe run your React application, we can access the React Query Devtools by opening your browser's developer tools. we'll find a "React Query" tab that provides an interface to monitor and manage 
//our queries and mutations.


/*
Using the Devtools:
The React Query Devtools allows us to:

1.View the status of our queries and mutations.
2.Inspect query data, error messages, and timings.
3.Manually trigger or refetch queries.
4.Pause or resume query fetching.
5.View and reset query caches.
6.It's a valuable tool for diagnosing issues with our data fetching and for understanding how React Query is managing your queries.
