# MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a design architecture widely used in software development to organize code and separate concerns within an application. It divides an application into three interconnected components, each having a distinct role:

## 1. Model
- Represents the data and business logic of the application.
- Manages and manipulates the data, implements business rules, and interacts with the database if required.
- Responsible for maintaining the application's state and ensuring data integrity.

## 2. View
- Represents the user interface or presentation layer.
- Displays information to the user and gathers input.
- Reacts to changes in the Model and updates the user interface accordingly.

## 3. Controller
- Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View.
- Handles user input and updates the Model and View accordingly.
- Contains the business logic and controls the flow of data within the application.

### In the Context of a Backend Application:
- **Model**: Represents the backend, encompassing database schemas, business logic, and rules. It manages data and ensures the integrity of the application's logic.
- **View**: Corresponds to the frontend or graphical user interface (GUI), responsible for presenting data to users and collecting input.
- **Controller**: Serves as the brains of the application, managing the interaction between the Model and View. It handles user input, updates the Model and View, and contains the core business logic.

### Setting Up the Directory Structure:
Arrange the project directory in the following way:

- **Controllers**: Files containing functions attached to each route path.
- **Routes**: Files containing routers that define the routes and link them to the corresponding controller functions.
- **Models**: To be discussed in later chapters, typically containing database schemas and business logic.
- **Views**: To be discussed in later chapters, often referring to the frontend or user interface components.

The MVC pattern helps modularize applications, making the code more maintainable, scalable, and easier to understand. It enhances collaboration among development teams working on different components of the application.
