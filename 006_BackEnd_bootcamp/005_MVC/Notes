MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern
MVC is a design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components, each having a specific role:

Model:
Represents the data and business logic of the application.
Manages the data, logic, and rules of the application.
Interacts with the database if needed.


View:
Represents the user interface or presentation layer.
Displays information to the user and gathers input.
Reacts to changes in the Model.

Controller:
Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View.
Handles user input and updates the Model and View accordingly.
Contains the business logic and controls the flow of data.


In the context of a backend :
Model: The backend that contains all the data logic ,  Involves database schemas, business logic, and rules.
View: The frontend or graphical user interface (GUI)
Controller: The brains of the application that controls how data is displayed
They help modularize the application and make the code more maintainable.

Setting Up the Directory Structure:
Arrange the project directory in the following way:
Controllers: Files containing functions attached to each route path.
Routes: Files containing routers.
Models: To be discussed in later chapters.
Views: To be discussed in later chapters
