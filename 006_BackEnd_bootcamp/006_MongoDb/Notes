MongoDB is a document database. It stores data in a type of JSON format called BSON.
The MongoDB Query API is the way you will interact with your data.
The MongoDB Query API can be used two ways:
CRUD Operations
Aggregation Pipelines


MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database management system that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, known as BSON (Binary JSON). It is designed to handle large amounts of data and provide high performance and scalability.

Here are some key features and concepts related to MongoDB:

1. **Document-Oriented:** MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON. These documents can have fields and values, and the data model is schema-less, allowing for flexibility in the structure of documents.

2. **Collections:** Collections are groups of MongoDB documents. Each document within a collection can have a different structure, and collections are analogous to tables in relational databases.

3. **Documents:** Documents are the basic unit of data in MongoDB. They are similar to rows in relational databases but can have nested structures.

4. **Fields:** Fields are key-value pairs within a document. Each field has a name and a value, and the value can be various data types, including other documents, arrays, and more.

5. **Indexes:** MongoDB supports indexing to improve query performance. Indexes can be created on single fields or compound indexes on multiple fields.

6. **Query Language:** MongoDB provides a rich query language for retrieving and manipulating data. Queries can be expressed using a JSON-like syntax.

7. **Aggregation Framework:** MongoDB's Aggregation Framework provides powerful data aggregation and transformation capabilities, allowing you to perform complex operations on your data.

8. **Sharding:** MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding. Sharding involves distributing data across multiple machines to improve performance and handle larger data sets.

9. **Replication:** MongoDB supports data replication for high availability. It allows for the creation of replica sets, where data is automatically copied to multiple servers.

10. **GridFS:** MongoDB includes a specification called GridFS for handling large files, such as images, videos, and audio files.

To interact with MongoDB, you can use the MongoDB shell, which is a command-line interface, or use official drivers for various programming languages like Python, Java, Node.js, and others.

It's worth noting that MongoDB is continuously evolving, and new features and improvements are regularly introduced. Make sure to check the official MongoDB documentation for the latest information and best practices.
