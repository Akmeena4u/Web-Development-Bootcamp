REST API using Express JS


HTTP Methods
HTTP methods define the type of request being made to the server. There are five primary HTTP methods:

GET: Retrieves a resource from the server. It performs a READ operation, and it is the default request method.
POST: Creates a new resource on the server. It performs a CREATE operation.
PUT and PATCH: Used to update a resource on the server. PUT generally replaces all content, while PATCH updates specific fields.
DELETE: Removes a resource from the server. It performs a DELETE operation.
REST API Structure
REST APIs are based on a combination of HTTP methods and resource paths. For example, considering a resource named "task," here are common REST APIs for tasks:

READ APIs:
GET /tasks: Read all tasks.
GET /task/:id: Read a specific task identified by a unique id.

CREATE APIs:
POST /tasks: Create a new task object (data in the request body).

UPDATE APIs:
PUT /task/:id: Update a specific task identified by a unique id. Replaces all content with data from the request body.
PATCH /task/:id: Update a specific task identified by a unique id. Only updates the fields specified in the request body.

DELETE APIs:
DELETE /task/:id: Delete a specific task identified by a unique id.



REST API (Representational State Transfer) is a standard for designing APIs. It revolves around accessing resources, such as a "Product," using a combination of HTTP methods and URL styles.

CRUD Operations in REST API
REST APIs commonly involve CRUD operations:

CREATE: POST /products - Create a new resource (e.g., product).

READ:
GET /products - Read many resources (e.g., products).
GET /products/:id - Read one specific resource (e.g., product).

UPDATE:
PUT /products/:id - Update by replacing all content of a specific resource (e.g., product).
PATCH /products/:id - Update by only setting content from the request body, not replacing other parts.

DELETE: DELETE /products/:id - Delete a specific resource (e.g., product).
