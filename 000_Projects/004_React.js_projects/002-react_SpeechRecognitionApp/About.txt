Objective:
My Speech Recongnition React application that utilizes the react-speech-recognition and react-use-clipboard libraries to create a Speech to Text Converter. 
The primary goal is to convert spoken words from the microphone into text and provide options for copying the transcribed text to the clipboard.

Steps:-
   1.we know by using pure react we can not make a speech recognition App here we will take help from a react node packet manager named as "react-speech-recognition"(https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-speech-recognition)
   2.useSpeechRecognition  -- is a React hook that gives a component access to a transcript of speech picked up from the user's microphone.
   3.SpeechRecognition  -- manages the global state of the Web Speech API, exposing functions to turn the microphone on and off.
   4.react-use-clipboard-
