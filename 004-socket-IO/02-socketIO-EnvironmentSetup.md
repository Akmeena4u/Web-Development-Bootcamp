Certainly, let's simplify the Socket.IO setup process:

### Setting Up Socket.IO Environment

To use Socket.IO, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. If you don't have them, you can install them from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

#### Check Installation:

Open your terminal and check if Node.js and npm are installed:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

Make sure you see version numbers like `v14.17.0` and `6.14.13`.

#### Create a Project Folder:

In your terminal, create a new folder for your project and go into it:

```bash
mkdir test-project
cd test-project
```

#### Initialize Your Project:

Run this command to create a `package.json` file:

```bash
npm init
```

Answer the questions that pop up during the setup.

#### Install Dependencies:

Now, install Express and Socket.IO and save them to your `package.json` file:

```bash
npm install --save express socket.io
```

#### Install Nodemon:

Nodemon is a tool that helps automatically restart your server when you make changes. Install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

Instead of using `node app.js` to start the server, use `nodemon app.js`. This way, you won't need to manually restart the server when you make changes, making your development process faster.

That's it! Your Socket.IO environment is ready. Now, you're all set to start building real-time applications with Socket.IO.
