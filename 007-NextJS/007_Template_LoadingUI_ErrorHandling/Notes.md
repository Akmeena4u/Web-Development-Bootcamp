# Understanding Template Files in Next.js

## Overview
In this , we'll explore template files provided by Next.js as part of the app router. Template files offer behavior distinct from layouts, providing a solution for scenarios where layouts' behavior may not be suitable.

### Layouts Behavior
- Layouts in Next.js wrap each child layout or page, preserving state and effects across route changes.
- However, layouts don't remount shared components, which can be limiting in scenarios requiring per-page instance creation.

### Example Scenario
- Imagine adding an input element to the layout to gather user data. Despite navigation between routes, the input state remains preserved due to layout behavior.

### Introducing Template Files
- Template files act as replacements for layouts in scenarios requiring per-page instance creation.
- Templates wrap each child layout or page, ensuring that a new instance of the component is mounted on navigation.

### Usage
- To define a template, export a default React component from either `template.js` or `template.tsx` file.
- Templates should accept a `children` prop, rendering nested segments in the route.

### Conversion
- Simply rename the existing `layout.tsx` file to `template.tsx` to utilize the template file.
- Upon navigation, the state is no longer preserved, indicating the significance of template files in the Next.js app router.

## Conclusion
- Template files offer a solution for scenarios where layouts' behavior of preserving state and effects across route changes is not desired.
- While layouts are the preferred choice for shared UI, templates provide a way to achieve per-page instance creation when needed.


**Note**: Evaluate the requirements of your application to determine whether layouts or templates are more suitable for your use case.

# Implementing Loading States in Next.js

## Overview
In this video, we'll explore the `loading.tsx` file, which allows us to create loading states displayed to users while specific route segments' content is loading. This feature enhances user experience by providing immediate feedback upon navigation, ensuring the application feels responsive.

### Usage
- To create a loading state, add a `loading.tsx` file to the designated folder for the route segment you want to implement the loading state for.
- The `loading.tsx` file should export a component called `Loading`, which returns an `<h1>` element with the text "Loading".


### Example Implementation
Let's consider implementing a loading state for the blog route segment:
```tsx
// pages/blog/loading.tsx
const Loading: React.FC = () => {
  return <h1>Loading</h1>;
};

export default Loading;
```

### Behavior
- The `loading.tsx` file automatically wraps the `page.tsx` file and all its nested children within a React Suspense boundary.
- When navigating to the route, users briefly see the loading text before it is replaced by the actual content.

### Benefits
1. **Immediate Feedback**: Users see the loading state as soon as they navigate to a new route, reducing perceived loading times and enhancing responsiveness.
2. **Interactive Layouts**: Next.js allows the creation of shared layouts that remain interactive while new route segments are loading, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### Customization
- Loading states can be designed in various ways, such as using loading indicators like skeletons and spinners or displaying a small part of the upcoming content, such as an image or title.

## Conclusion
- By following the loading UI convention, you can provide users with a seamless and uninterrupted experience while ensuring loading states do not obstruct the functionality of shared layouts.
- Implementing loading states in Next.js enhances the overall user experience and responsiveness of the application.


**Note**: Ensure to place the `loading.tsx` file in the designated folder for instant loading states in the new app router.

# Error Handling in Next.js

## Overview
In this , we'll explore error handling in Next.js using a special file named `error.tsx`. Error handling is crucial for providing a better user experience by gracefully handling errors that occur during runtime.

### Error Scenario
- Imagine navigating to a route like `/products/1/reviews/1` to view a review, but encountering an error due to a failed network request or other issues.

### Implementation
1. **Introduce Error Scenario**: Create a function `getRandomInt` to simulate an error scenario by throwing an error randomly in the `reviewID` page component.
   ```typescript
   // reviewID.tsx
   function getRandomInt(max: number) {
       return Math.floor(Math.random() * max);
   }

   const random = getRandomInt(2);
   if (random === 1) {
       throw new Error('Error loading review');
   }
   ```

2. **Create Error Component**: In the `pages/products/[productID]/reviews/[reviewID]` folder, create an `error.tsx` file.
   ```typescript
   // error.tsx
   import { useClient } from 'next';

   export default function ErrorBoundary({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
       const isClient = useClient();
       
       if (!isClient) return null;

       return (
           <div>
               <p>Error in Review ID</p>
           </div>
       );
   }
   ```

### Benefits of Error Handling
- **Improved User Experience**: Users see a meaningful error message instead of a generic application error.
- **Isolated Error Handling**: Errors in deeply nested components like `reviewID` don't break the entire application, ensuring other parts remain functional.
- **Recovery Options**: The error component can attempt to recover from errors without requiring a full page reload.

### File Hierarchy
- **Layout**: Wraps around the entire application layout.
- **Template**: Renders nested segments within a route.
- **Error Boundary (error.tsx)**: Handles runtime errors within a specific segment.
- **Suspense Boundary (loading.tsx)**: Displays loading states while content is loading.
- **Error Boundary (not-found.tsx)**: Handles scenarios when the resource is not found.
- **Page**: Represents the actual page content.

## Conclusion
By implementing error handling with `error.tsx`, we can handle unexpected errors in our application gracefully, providing a smoother user experience. In upcoming videos, we'll dive deeper into error handling techniques.


**Note**: Ensure the `error.tsx` file is a client component and uses the `useClient` directive at the top to resolve any issues.

# Recovering from Errors in Next.js

## Introduction
In the previous video, we learned about handling errors using the `error.tsx` file. However, some errors may not be critical and could be resolved by retrying. In this video, we'll explore how to recover from such errors.

### Error Recovery
The `error.tsx` file provides an error boundary component that receives a `reset` function prop along with the `error` object. We can destructure this function and add a button in the JSX to trigger the reset function, offering users a way to retry rendering the component.

### Implementation
1. **Add Retry Button**: In the `error.tsx` file, add a button that triggers the `reset` function on click.
   ```typescript
   // error.tsx
   export default function ErrorBoundary({ error, reset }: { error: Error, reset: () => void }) {
       return (
           <div>
               <p>{error.message}</p>
               <button onClick={reset}>Try Again</button>
           </div>
       );
   }
   ```

2. **Convert to Client-Side Component**: To ensure error recovery works on the client-side, convert the `page.tsx` file to a client component by adding `useClient` at the top.
   ```typescript
   // page.tsx
   import { useClient } from 'next';

   // Rest of the component
   ```

### Error Recovery Process
- When an error occurs, the error boundary displays the error message along with a "Try Again" button.
- Clicking the button triggers the `reset` function, attempting to render the component again.
- If successful, the error boundary replaces the error message with the re-rendered content from the `page.tsx` file.

## Summary
Recovering from errors in the new app router involves executing the `reset` function provided by the error boundary. This function attempts to re-render the component, allowing users to retry loading the content.

## Conclusion
In the upcoming v, we'll continue exploring error handling techniques. Thank you for watching, and don't forget to subscribe to the channel for more content.


**Note**: Ensure both the `error.tsx` and `page.tsx` files are client components to enable error recovery on the client-side.

# Handling Errors Within Nested Routes in Next.js

## Introduction
In this video, we'll delve into handling errors within nested routes in the new app router. Currently, our `error.tsx` file is positioned within the `reviewID` folder, which is nested within the `products` route. We'll explore how the placement of the error file affects error handling in nested routes.

### Understanding Error Bubbling
Errors in Next.js bubble up to the closest parent error boundary. This means that an `error.tsx` file will handle errors for all its nested child segments. By positioning `error.tsx` files at different levels within the nested folder structure, we can achieve more granular error handling.

### Implementation
1. **Move Error File**: Let's move the `error.tsx` file from the `reviewID` folder to the `products` folder.

2. **Observation**: After refreshing the browser and triggering an error, we'll observe how error handling differs based on the placement of the error file.

### Error Handling Behavior
- **Error in Products Route**: If the `error.tsx` file is placed in the `products` folder, errors within any nested child segments, such as `productID` or `reviewID`, will replace the entire `products` route with the UI from the `error.tsx` file.

- **Error in Review ID Route**: Conversely, if the `error.tsx` file is moved back to the `reviewID` folder, only the `review` component will be replaced by the UI from the `error.tsx` file, leaving the rest of the UI intact, such as the featured products section from the `productID` layout.

### Granular Error Handling
The placement of the `error.tsx` file plays a crucial role in determining the scope of error handling. It allows for more precise control over which parts of the UI are affected when errors occur deeper in the nested route hierarchy.

## Conclusion
Understanding how errors bubble up to parent error boundaries and how the placement of the error file influences error handling is essential for effective error management in nested routes. In the next video, we'll explore handling errors within layouts.

# Handling Errors Within Layouts in Next.js

## Introduction
In this , we'll focus on handling errors within layouts in the new app router. While an `error.tsx` file effectively handles errors for nested child segments, there's a nuance when it comes to errors within layouts.

### Layouts and Error Boundaries
Layout components, defined in `layout.tsx`, sit above the error boundary in the component hierarchy. Errors thrown within a layout component are not caught by the error boundary, as they are nested inside the layout.

### Practical Example
Let's understand this with a practical example:
1. **Replicate Error.tsx**: Copy the `error.tsx` file from the `reviewID` route and paste it into the `productID` route.
2. **Emulate Error in Layout**: In the `productID` layout file (`layout.tsx`), emulate a random error similar to the one in the `reviewID` page.

### Observation
After reloading the page multiple times, we encounter the error "error loading product", but there's no error boundary to catch it. Our app is now in a broken state because errors thrown within a layout component are not handled by the error boundary.

### Solution
To address this issue, we need to place the `error.tsx` file in the layout's parent segment. In this case, we'll move the `error.tsx` file from the `productID` folder to the `products` folder.

### Result
Upon reloading the page and encountering the error again, we observe that our app remains intact. The error boundary now renders in place of the products route, while the header, footer, and other UI elements higher up in the component tree remain unaffected.

## Conclusion
The placement of the `error.tsx` file is crucial for efficiently managing errors across different segments of our application, ensuring that errors within layouts are properly handled without affecting the overall UI.
