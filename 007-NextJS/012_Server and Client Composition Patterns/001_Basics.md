### Overview: Server and Client Composition Patterns in React

**React Server Components (RSCs) and Dual Component Model:**
- **React Server Components (RSCs):** Enable server-side rendering and handling of certain tasks to improve performance and reduce client-side JavaScript.
- **Dual Component Model:** Combines server and client components to optimize the performance and functionality of React applications.

### Server Components

**Use Cases:**
1. **Fetching Data:** Efficiently retrieve data from the server, reducing the need for client-side data fetching.
2. **Accessing Backend Resources:** Direct access to databases, APIs, and other backend services without exposing sensitive information.
3. **Protecting Sensitive Information:** Keep secure data handling on the server to avoid exposing it to the client.
4. **Managing Large Dependencies:** Load heavy dependencies on the server, reducing the client's JavaScript bundle size.

**Benefits:**
- Reduces client-side load by offloading tasks to the server.
- Enhances security by keeping sensitive operations server-side.
- Improves performance by minimizing the client’s JavaScript footprint.

### Client Components

**Use Cases:**
1. **Adding Interactivity:** Enhance user experience with interactive elements.
2. **Handling Event Listeners:** Manage user events like clicks, scrolls, and input changes.
3. **Managing State and Lifecycle Effects:** Use React’s state management and lifecycle methods for dynamic behavior.
4. **Browser Exclusive APIs:** Utilize APIs that are only available in the browser environment (e.g., `localStorage`, `navigator`).
5. **Using Custom Hooks:** Implement custom hooks to manage reusable logic.
6. **React Class Components:** Continue using class components for legacy code or specific use cases.

**Benefits:**
- Provides a responsive and interactive user experience.
- Allows for complex state management and side effects.
- Enables the use of browser-specific features and APIs.
