**Next.js for Beginners Series - Introduction**

**Next.js Overview:**

- ** 0. Adoption by Companies:**
  - Notable companies like Netflix, TikTok, Twitch, Hulu, Notion, Target, and Nike use Next.js.
  - Node.js website migrated to Next.js for long-term use.

**1. What is Next.js?**
- Next.js is a React framework for building web applications.
- It simplifies the process of building fully-featured, production-ready applications by providing additional features beyond React.
- Features include routing, optimized rendering, data fetching, bundling, and more.

**2. Why Learn Next.js?**
- Next.js simplifies the process of building production-ready web applications.
- Noteworthy features:
  - File-based routing for simplicity.
  - Support for API routes, making it a full-stack framework.
  - Server-side and client-side rendering for performance and SEO.
  - Simplified data fetching with async/await support.
  - Support for various styling methods (CSS modules, Tailwind CSS, CSS-in-JS).
  - Optimization for images, fonts, and scripts.
  - Well-optimized development and production build system.
  -  Automatic Code Splitting:**-  automatic code splitting reduces initial load time.  ages are split into smaller chunks, loaded as needed for faster navigation.

**3. Prerequisites**
- Solid understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals.
- Familiarity with modern JavaScript (ES6+) features.
- Essential knowledge of React fundamentals: function components, props, state, JSX, and hooks.

**4. Series Content**
- The series aims to guide from a complete beginner to becoming an expert in Next.js.

  **5. Project structure**
  -**Understanding Next.js Project Structure**

1. **Individual Files:**
   - **package.json:**
     - Dependencies and scripts.
   - **Dependencies:**
     - next, react, react-dom, typescript, tailwindcss, postcss, autoprefixer, eslint.
   - **Scripts:**
     - Dev (start app in development), Build (build app for production), Start (start app production server), Lint (set up Next.js built-in ESLint).
   - **Configuration Files:**
     - next.config.js, tsconfig.json, eslintrc.json, tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js.
   - **Other Files:**
     - package-lock.json, .gitignore, README.md, next-env.d.ts (Typescript Declarations for Next).

2. **Folders:**
   - **next Folder:**
     - Generated when running dev or build scripts.
     - Serves the Next.js application.
   - **node_modules Folder:**
     - Contains project dependencies.
     - Generated by npm install or automatically during script execution.
   - **public Folder:**
     - Holds static assets like images and SVGs.
   - **src Folder (Source):**
     - **app Folder:**
       - **favicon.ico:** Browser tab icon.
       - **global.css:** Global styles for the app.
       - **layout.tsx:** Root layout component.
       - **page.tsx:** Unique UI for visiting localhost:3000.
     - **Other Files:**
       - **components Folder (Not Discussed):**
         - **Header.tsx:** Example component.
       - **styles Folder (Not Discussed):**
         - **Home.module.css:** Example CSS module.

3. **Flow of Control:**
   - Running `npm run dev` starts the control flow:
     - `package.json` → `layout.tsx` → `page.tsx` → Browser.
   - `layout.tsx` renders the root layout component.
   - `page.tsx` defines the UI component for localhost:3000.
   - Execution is transferred to the browser, displaying the UI.

4. **Important Concepts Introduced:**
   - **App Router:**
     - Works within the `app` folder.
     - Utilizes components like `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx`.
   - **Control Flow:**
     - Execution flow from `package.json` to components to browser rendering.

**Next Steps:**
- In the upcoming video, explore important React concepts foundational to writing Next.js code.
