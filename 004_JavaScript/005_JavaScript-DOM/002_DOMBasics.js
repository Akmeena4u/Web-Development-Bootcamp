/*********************************************************------JS DOM----************************************************************************
The JavaScript Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects. It provides a way for scripts to interact with the structure, style, and content of HTML and XML documents. With the DOM, you can dynamically manipulate and update the content and structure of a web page.

JS Engine converts all HTML code of a website into a js object, that represents the structure and content of web documents
The document object represents the entire HTML or XML document.

With the Document object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page*/

// Access the document object
var myDocument = document;
console.log(myDocument);
console.log(myDocument.body);
