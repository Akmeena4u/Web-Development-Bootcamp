# Using $0 in Browser Developer Tools Console

In JavaScript, $0 is a special variable often used in the browser's developer tools console. It represents the currently selected element in the Elements panel of the browser's DevTools, allowing direct interaction and manipulation with the selected HTML element from the console.

Here's how you can use $0:

1. **Select an Element**: Navigate to the Elements panel in the browser's developer tools and select an HTML element by clicking on it.

2. **Access Properties**: You can access properties and methods of the selected element directly from the console using $0. For example, you can access its properties or change its attributes.

Examples of using $0 in the console:

```javascript
// Access the innerHTML property of the selected element
console.log($0.innerHTML);

// Change the background color of the selected element
$0.style.backgroundColor = "yellow";

// Change the text content of the selected element
$0.textContent = "New Text";
$0.style.backgroundColor = "red";
```

$0 provides a convenient way to inspect, modify, and test HTML elements interactively in the browser's console during development.
