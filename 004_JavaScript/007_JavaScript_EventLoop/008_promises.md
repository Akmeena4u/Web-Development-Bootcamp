# Promises in JavaScript

Promises are a JavaScript feature introduced to handle asynchronous operations more effectively. They provide a cleaner and more structured way to work with asynchronous code compared to traditional callback functions.

## Basics of Promises

### Promise States:

- **Pending:** The initial state; the promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- **Fulfilled/Resolved:** The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.
- **Rejected:** The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure.

## Creating Promises

```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Asynchronous operation
  // If successful, call resolve with the result
  // If an error occurs, call reject with the reason
});
```

## Chaining in Promises

```javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Asynchronous operation
});

myPromise
  .then((result) => {
    // Handle fulfillment
    return anotherPromise; // Return a new promise for chaining
  })
  .then((result) => {
    // Handle the result of the second promise
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    // Handle any rejection in the chain
  });
```

## Promise.all and Promise.race

### `Promise.all([promise1, promise2, ...])`:

Combines multiple promises into a single promise that fulfills with an array of the fulfilled values.

```javascript
const promises = [promise1, promise2, promise3];
Promise.all(promises)
  .then((results) => {
    // Handle an array of results
  })
  .catch((reason) => {
    // Handle any rejection
  });
```

Understanding promises and their features is essential for writing clean and efficient asynchronous code in JavaScript.
