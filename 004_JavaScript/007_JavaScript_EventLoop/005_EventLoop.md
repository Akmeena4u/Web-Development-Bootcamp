# Event Loop in JavaScript

The event loop is a crucial part of JavaScript's concurrency model, responsible for handling asynchronous operations and ensuring that your code remains responsive to user interactions and other asynchronous events. Here's a simplified explanation of how the event loop works in JavaScript:

## Components:

### 1. Call Stack

The call stack keeps track of the currently executing functions and their contexts. When a function is called, a new frame is pushed onto the call stack, and when the function completes, its frame is popped from the stack.

### 2. Browser

When an event listener entry comes into the call stack, the browser gives control to the browser itself and removes the entry from the call stack. After a specified event wait or when the event occurs, the browser adds the corresponding function to the Event Queue.

### 3. Event Queue

The Event Queue executes functions when the call stack becomes empty. It ensures that asynchronous tasks, such as those triggered by setTimeout or event listeners, are processed without blocking the main thread.

## Examples:

### a. `setTimeout`

```javascript
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log('Timeout callback');
}, 1000);

console.log('End');
```

In this example, the 'Start' is logged, then the `setTimeout` function is offloaded to the browser, and after the specified timeout (1 second), the 'Timeout callback' is logged. Finally, 'End' is logged.

### b. Event Listeners

```javascript
console.log('Start');

const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

button.addEventListener('click', function () {
  console.log('Button clicked');
});

console.log('End');
```

In this example, 'Start' is logged, an event listener is attached to a button, and 'End' is logged. When the button is clicked, 'Button clicked' is logged asynchronously.

These three components work in a loop, allowing JavaScript to efficiently handle both synchronous and asynchronous tasks, providing a responsive and non-blocking execution environment.
