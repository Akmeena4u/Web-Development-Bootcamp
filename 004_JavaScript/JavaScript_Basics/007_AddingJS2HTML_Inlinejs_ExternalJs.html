<!--Adding JavaScript to an HTML document is typically done by including JavaScript code within <script> elements

Inline JavaScript: You can include JavaScript code directly within your HTML file using the <script> element. Place this element within the <head> or <body> section of your HTML document 

External JavaScript File:
For larger or reusable JavaScript code, it's a good practice to place the code in an external JavaScript file with a .js extension and then include 
it in your HTML file using the <script> element's src attribute. -->
