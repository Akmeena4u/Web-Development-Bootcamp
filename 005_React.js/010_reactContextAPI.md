# Context API in React

The Context API in React is a solution to prop drilling. It enables the sharing of data between components without the need to pass props explicitly through every level of the component tree. By creating a context at a higher level in the component tree, you can access that context in any component that needs the shared data.

## Using the Context API

1. **Create a Context:**
   - First, create a context using `React.createContext()`. This is typically done at the top level of your component hierarchy (e.g., `App.jsx` or `TopComponent.jsx`).
   ```jsx
   const MyContext = React.createContext();
   ```

2. **Provide Data:**
   - Wrap the part of your component tree where you want to share data with a `MyContext.Provider` component. Provide the data you want to share as a `value` prop.
   ```jsx
   <MyContext.Provider value={/* data to share */}>
     {/* Components that can consume the context */}
   </MyContext.Provider>
   ```

3. **Consume Data:**
   - Any component that needs access to the shared data can consume the context using the `MyContext.Consumer` component or the `useContext` hook.
   ```jsx
   <MyContext.Consumer>
     {(data) => {
       return (
         /* render with data */
       );
     }}
   </MyContext.Consumer>
   ```
   - Using `useContext`:
   ```jsx
   const data = useContext(MyContext);
   ```

**NOTE:**
- In the consumer block, a function is written, and within that function, what needs to be returned is defined.
- There is only one function in the consumer block. If multiple contexts are needed, they must be nested inside each other, similarly in the provider block.

## Problems with Context API

1. **Complexity and Propagation:**
   - As the application grows, managing and propagating context providers can lead to complex nesting, making it harder to understand the data flow.

2. **Nested Contexts:**
   - When working with nested contexts, there's a possibility of consuming the wrong context accidentally, leading to unexpected behavior.
