# React Hooks

React hooks are a set of functions provided by the React library, introduced in React 16.8, that empower functional components to manage state, handle side effects, and incorporate other React features traditionally exclusive to class components. Hooks address various challenges and limitations of class components and encourage the use of functional components.

## Key Aspects and Features

1. **State Management:**
   - The `useState` hook allows functional components to manage local component state.
   - State variables can be declared and updated within a functional component.

2. **Side Effects:**
   - The `useEffect` hook enables functional components to handle side effects, such as data fetching, subscriptions, and interaction with the DOM.
   - It replaces the `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle methods found in class components.

3. **Reusability:**
   - Hooks promote the reusability of stateful logic, encouraging the creation of custom hooks for sharing logic.

4. **Complex Component Logic:**
   - Hooks make it easier to manage complex component logic by encapsulating it in custom hooks.

5. **Improved Code Organization:**
   - Hooks encourage better code organization within functional components.

## Hook Rules

There are three rules for using hooks:

1. Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
2. Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
3. Hooks cannot be conditional.

## Custom Hook Naming Convention

4. All custom hooks should be prefixed with "use" to indicate that they are hooks. For example, `useCounter`.
