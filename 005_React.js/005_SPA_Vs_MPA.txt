Multi-Page Application (MPA) vs. Single Page Application (SPA):

Multi-Page Application (MPA):
In an MPA, when a client requests a specific page, the server responds by rendering the HTML, CSS, and JS for that page, which is then loaded onto the client's device.
Each page has its own set of HTML, CSS, and JS files, and a new request to the server is made for each page.


Single Page Application (SPA):
In a SPA, the client sends a request to the server, and the server responds with all the HTML, CSS, and JS required for the entire application with the initial request.
Once loaded, the SPA uses JavaScript and APIs to dynamically populate and update content as the user interacts with the application, without requiring full page reloads.
Subsequent user requests for different content do not result in additional server requests to load HTML; instead, the SPA handles it on the client side.

Advantages and disadvantages  of Single-Page Applications:
1. SPAs save bandwidth, making them suitable for high-traffic applications.
2. They offer an improved user experience with quick loading times, as they avoid full page reloads.
3. Speed: SPAs can provide a faster and more seamless user experience during navigation, while MPAs may have slower page transitions due to full reloads.
4. Complexity: SPAs often involve more complex client-side development, while MPAs might have simpler server-side development.
5.SEO Benefits:MPAs are often considered more SEO-friendly because search engines can easily crawl and index individual HTML pages. Content is readily available for indexing.
