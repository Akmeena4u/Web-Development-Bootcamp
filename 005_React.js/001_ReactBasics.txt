React, sometimes referred to as a frontend JavaScript framework, is a JavaScript library created by Facebook.React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React is used to build single-page applications.React allows us to create reusable UI components.

How does React Work?
Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.

          b. npm run build --This script creates a production build of your app , it minimies our code and all outputs saved here , we can use it in deployment/production phase
       6. deployment- now we can deploy our project on hosting sites like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or traditional web hosts.
